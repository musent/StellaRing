<h1>StellaRing</h1>
<p>Here's where some text explaining the webring would go. I'm too lazy to write it all out, someone please make a commit with the needed text in here later.

<p>If the ring is broken, please <a href={{site.github_repo_url}}/issues/new>submit an error report on GitHub</a>.

<h2 id=members>Members ({{site.data.members.size}})</h2>
<ul>
{% for member in site.data.members %}
<li><a href="{{member.url | xml_escape}}">{{member.name | xml_escape | newline_to_br}}</a>{% endfor %}
</ul>
